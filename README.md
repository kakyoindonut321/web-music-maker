# Web Music Maker

This is an online music maker where you can make and draw any music you want, if you know how.

## UPDATE!!!

- I've made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I do not expected to be forgiven, I've mention before how you can save your patterns in our database with accounts? I've consider to abandon that idea as they also abandon making this as the assignment, and instead go with a cheap, download export and import instead.

## Features

- 4 different musical instrument, all generated using math instead of audio file
- change _patterns_ length and tempo(bpm)
- ~~save your patterns in our database~~ _abandoned_
- many more

## Limitation

- you can only make music 1 instrument at a time, meaning you cannot combine multiple instrument in the same pattern board.
- limited to 1/5 tempo bpm, which mean you cannot have 2 or more notes on the same beat
- ~~password is not protected with encryption, who the fuck wants to steal your pattern anyway.~~ _abandoned_
- many more, many less

## Limitation

- you can only make music 1 instrument at a time, meaning you cannot combine multiple instrument in the same pattern board.
- limited to 1/5 tempo bpm, which mean you cannot have 2 or more notes on the same beat
- password is not protected with encryption, who the fuck wants to steal your pattern anyway.
- many more, many less
